We will begin an exciting journey to build a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

Milestone 1 Project Overview

Full stack consist of both frontend and backend.
In Frontend devolepment we will use technologies like HTML, CSS, React.js and in backend devolepment we will use MERN stack (MongoDB, Expess.js, React.js, Node.js).
The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications.The MERN stack is favored for its JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application (both front-end and back-end).
A REST API allows two systems (like a web app and a server) to communicate using standard internet methods. 
User Authentication: Allow users to sign up with their details (like email and password). It verify user credentials and give access.
Product Management add new products (e.g., name, price, description).Update product details, retrieve product information for the user.
Order Handling :Create and manage customer orders (what they buy, quantity, etc.) and save and retrieve order details.
All communication between the client and server happens in BJSON format.
A schema defines how data is organized in a database.
